# WONDROUS WORLD OF AUGZIDRAAL
## About
<p>
	This is a reference guide of all the creatures and things that exist in the Universe of Augzidral (AWG ▪ zee ▪ Draal). Many of these creatures and even some of the objects of this Universe have been found in this Universe as well. For example, SCP-███-█ was discovered to be in this world. How it got there is still a mystery and many of the people who walked into it are still missing to this day. The big difference between this world and Augzidral is that there is no such thing as death. This may sound confusing, but first let me explain how the creatures of Augzidral exist. The living purely exists of Life-Force or the Aug and can use its powers to raise the defenses of other living, heal, or attack the Draal. On the other hand, the dead exist purely off the energy provided by the Draal. There is a third force called Natural Law otherwise known as Zi but not much is known about it. The only known information on the Zi is from the memories passed down from the Draal and Aug forces.

	The Aug are often referred to as the living, but, there is barely difference between them and the Draal. First let me clarify what I mean by the Aug. The term Aug is an umbrella term to describe all the creatures that use the Aug forces. The main differences between the Aug and the Draal is that the Aug can procreate and age, which is why they are often seen as the living. Everything an Aug does uses some of the Aug. Even communicating uses the Aug, although very small amounts, but the thing they are communicating to receives the Aug and is added into their Life-Force. Beings of the Aug use the Aug to procreate and their offspring contain the Life-Force put within them from their parents.

	The Draal are mostly referred to the dead since when an Aug runs out of Life-Force, the Draal is replaces it. When a being gives in to the Draal, they will often lose all their experience of their past life, the farther they submit to the Draal the more memories of their past lives are given up. In the beginning, a Draal cannot see the living nor interact with them as they do not have enough of the Draal force within them yet. The only thing they can interact with is their surroundings. To get more of the Draal into their bodies’, the newly-made Draal often will hurt themselves or fling themselves off of high places. This allows more of the Draal inside as it pushes the last bits of Life-Force outside. This is the only way to escape the limbo stage it seems. There are a few who stay at this state forever however, these beings are called Lost Souls or Drifters, and they contain bounds of knowledge within them although not containing either the Aug nor the Draal within them. At the limbo stage, neither other Draal or the Aug can see you, too. After exiting the Limbo stage however, it reveals the world of the Draal.

	The Zi is a force above both the Aug and Draal and not much is known about it. The only information on the Zi is that it keeps the balance between Aug beings and Draal beings. Other than these facts, the whole concept is shrouded in mystery.

## History
<p>
	The history of Augzidraal is covered in few mysteries since the experiences of each other’s experiences are stored inside of the Draal and Aug forces. The only times information can be lost is if an Aug does not transfer their life force to another before fading into the Draal. According to the texts at the Valdin library the Universe started with one powerful being that then created two other, less powerful beings which were the Aug and the Draal. The first being is thought to be Zi, but nothing confirms it as fact. The first beings reasoning behind creating the Draal and the Aug were because they were supposed to bring a balance to the universe, where nothing is lost only transferred. This was done because the first being, coined the name Vivali, was thought to have created a Universe before this one where the creatures just drifted around for immortality with no purpose and Vivali saw it as a failure. Thus, was thought, to bring purpose into creatures lives as it would give them a limited time before having to leave to go into the next world of Draal.
</p>
<p>
	There were three Great Wars where the Draal and the Aug have fought each other, the first has almost no information on it since it was before there was a physical world and the only beings were primordial beings with equal power to the Draal and the Aug. The whereabouts of these beings are unknown but in some ancient texts there is some indication that these beings were made a part of the Aug and Draal, with a few going on to make their own dimensions. 
</p>
<p>
	The second war was over who got domain over Vivali’s newly created world. In the end, the Aug won this war by sheer numbers since the living outnumbered the, relatively, new Draal creatures. However, because of this war the Draal built up an army of an equivalent size afterwards. The second war probably bares the most significance of all the wars since it is the period of which Vivali stops appearing anywhere in text and the first mentions of a new force called the Zi is mentioned.
</p>
<p>
	The third war, the one that is currently being waged, is being fought over control of the Vergi. The Vergi are structures of infinite depth which contain powerful treasures and knowledge. There was a story of a Draal who learned the abilities of the Aug in a dungeon and allied with the Aug, his name was Nin Pol Lim. In this instance, the first situation where the Zi was seen in action was recorded. It was the first time a real death happened in Augzidraal, since Nin Pol Lim learned the Aug he only had a limited time to live. Since he was already a Draal at his time of fading, his life force simply compounded within itself in a flash of yellow light. This is what brought the war, since Nin Pol Lim figured out how to permanently wipe something off Augzidraal, the Draal and the Aug wanted to get to it first. The Draal want to get this power because then they will be immortal without having to worry about the Aug attacking and the Aug wanted to get it to keep the Draal from permanently killing them.
</p>
<p>
	Now this brings up the point of, why do the Aug and Draal need to fight? It is quite simple, to be quite honest. When the Aug heal the Draal, they get double the amount of Life-Force from what they put in. The Aug need this Life-Force to stay an Aug and as an Aug they get the benefits of keeping their memories, creating an offspring, being able to interact with the world, and having the ability to enter and leave Vergi. A Draal, on the other hand, do not get these benefits. A Draal cannot build or really touch anything in general and must rely on spells that spend on the Draal force within their beings. They cannot procreate because they have a negative amount of life force and their memories are only the memories of when they became a Draal and nothing more.
